# Golang Binary Concepts

Learn how to build Golang binaries targeting different platforms and include varying features from the same codebase.

Example application for the article: [Golang: Golang: Building Binaries with Different Features and Options from the SameÂ Codebase](
https://medium.com/@matt.wiater/golang-building-binaries-with-different-features-and-options-from-the-same-codebase-118fef52340b)

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:mwiater/golangbuildconcepts.git
cd golangbuildconcepts
go get
```

## Application

### Convenience Commands

**NOTE:** _This repository was created to run on a linux x86 machine. There are example `make` commands and scripts to cross-compile to other architectures, but these convenience methods have only been tested from a linux x86 source (though the corss-compiled binaries have been successfully tested on the appropriate source architectures). If you are on another source architecture, native `go` commands should work fine, but the build scripts included here may not. See the `./scripts` directory to see what the bash scripts are doing--you should be able to infer the native `go` commands for your system, if you have issues executing any of the convenience scripts._

Type `make` for a list of commands (comments added for clarity):

```
Targets in this Makefile:

make golang-build-linux64
make golang-build-linux64-beta
make golang-build-linux64-subscription
make golang-build-windows64
make golang-build-windows64-beta
make golang-build-windows64-subscription
make golang-run

For details on these commands, see the bash scripts in the 'scripts/' directory.
```

## Run the application

Type: `make golang-run`

## Bonus: Testing Application Binaries for Different Platforms from the Same Docker Container

As an avid Docker user, I chose to go the container route to test the application binaries. This has a few benefits:

* A completely clean install and build environment for the application.
* The ability (via wine) to run both Linux and Windows binaries.

The Dockerfile is doing some heavy lifting, so building the image may take some time, maybe a few minutes.

```
clear && docker build -t golangbuildconcepts . && \
  docker run -it --rm golangbuildconcepts
```

```
